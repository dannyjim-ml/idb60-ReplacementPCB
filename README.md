# Aftermarket idb60 pcb

## Introduction
This aftermarket pcb for the idb60 is plain and simple - an MX replacement pcb with USB-C, ESD protection, and a new bottom row option. This PCB has been produced previously by JLCPCB, and tested to fit and work with the original idb60 case.

**The current implementation of the RGB caps lock indicator is nonfunctional and should be either removed or updated prior to future production. The original intended RGB LED was the [SK6812MINI-E](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/4960/4960_SK6812MINI-E_REV02_EN.pdf). The RGB indicator should also be slightly relocated further south since currently, the switch covers a majority of it up.**
